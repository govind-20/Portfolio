                        <summary>Can you tell me about yourself? </summary>
                        <p>"Sure! I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering, specializing in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in fundamental engineering principles, and problem-solving skills. I am passionate about applying my knowledge and skills to real-world projects.
                            
                            In addition to my academic achievements, I have a solid understanding of engineering software and tools such as VS Code, Github, Jupyter Notebook. I am good in Python, HTML, CSS and javascript and have utilized these skills in various coursework and personal projects.
                            
                            As a fresher, I am excited to kickstart my career as an engineer, contributing my knowledge and skills to innovative projects and continually learning and growing in the field. I am enthusiastic about embracing new technologies, staying updated with industry trends, and working collaboratively in a team environment."</p>
